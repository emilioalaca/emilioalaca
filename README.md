- Hi, I’m Emilio @emilioalaca
- I’m interested in applied statistics, epistemology, mechanistic and statistical modeling, road bike riding and beer.
- I’m currently learning Bayesian methods and teaching myself to pain with acrylic and draw with color pencils.
- Reach me at emilioalaca at gmail dot com

Some day I will make a decent README.md, but for now this is it.
